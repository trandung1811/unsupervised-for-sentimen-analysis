they never bring a salad we ask for 
this hole in the wall have great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 
take an hour to get our food only table in restaurant my food be luke warm our sever be run around like he be totally overwhelm 
the worst be the salmon sashimi 
also there be combos like a burger fry and beer for which be a decent deal 
this be like the final blow 
i find this place by accident and i could not be happier 
seem like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 
overall i like this place a lot 
the only redeem quality of the restaurant be that it be very inexpensive 
ample portion and good price 
poor service the waiter make me feel like i be stupid every time he come to the table 
my first visit to hiro be a delight 
service suck 
the shrimp tender and moist 
there be not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 
hard to judge whether these side be good because we be gross out by the melt styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of get sick 
on a positive note our server be very attentive and provide great service 
freeze pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 
the only thing i do like be the prime rib and dessert section 
its too bad the food be so damn generic 
the burger be good beef cook just right 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 
my side greek salad with the greek dress be so tasty and the pita and hummus be very refresh 
we order the duck rare and it be pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 
he come run after us when he realize my husband have leave his sunglasses on the table 
their chow mein be so good 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 
the portion be huge 
love itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas be an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 
not much seafood and like string of pasta at the bottom 
the salad have just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which be perfectly cook 
the rip banana be not only rip but petrify and tasteless 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for minutes 
this place receive star for their appetizers

a great way to finish a great 
the deal include taste and drink and jeff go above and beyond what we expect 
really really good rice all the time 
the service be meh 
it take over min to get their milkshake which be nothing more than chocolate milk 
i guess i should have know that this place would suck because it be inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 
the scallop dish be quite appal for value as well 
time very bad customer service 
the sweet potato fry be very good and season well 
today be the second time ive be to their lunch buffet and it be pretty good 
there be so much good food in vegas that i feel cheat for waste an eat opportunity by go to rice and company 
come here be like experience an underwhelming relationship where both party cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 
walk in and the place smell like an old grease trap and only others there eat 
the turkey and roast beef be bland 
this place have it 
the pan cake everyone be rave about taste like a sugary disaster tailor to the palate of a six year old 
i love the pho and the spring roll oh so yummy you have to try 
the poor batter to meat ratio make the chicken tender very unsatisfying 
all i have to say be the food be amaze 
omelets be to die for 
everything be fresh and delicious 
in summary this be a largely disappoint din experience 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirt with the hottest person at the party

favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 
the black eye peas and sweet potatoes unreal

i go to far too many place and ive never see any restaurant that serve a egg breakfast especially for 
when my mom and i get home she immediately get sick and she only have a few bite of salad

the manager be the worst 
the inside be really quite nice and very clean 
the food be outstanding and the price be very reasonable 
i dont think ill be run back to carlys anytime soon for food 
this be be due to the fact that it take minutes to be acknowledge then another minutes to get our foodand they keep forget things 
love the margaritas too 
this be my first and only vegas buffet and it do not disappoint 
very good though 
the one down note be the ventilation could use some upgrade

total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 
third the cheese on my friends burger be cold 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 
the steaks be all well trim and also perfectly cook 
we have a group of when we claim we would only have and they handle us beautifully 
i love it 
we ask for the bill to leave without eat and they didnt bring that either 
this place be a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive be hop to find in nearly ten years live here 
seafood be limit to boil shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely do not taste fresh 
the selection of food be not the best 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 
this isnt a small family restaurant this be a fine din establishment 
they have a toro tartare with a cavier that be extraordinary and i like the thinly slice wagyu with white truffle 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 
it be attach to a gas station and that be rarely a good sign 
how awesome be that 
i will be back many time soon 
the menu have so much good stuff on it i could not decide

and then tragedy strike 
the pancake be also really good and pretty large at that 
this be my first crawfish experience and it be delicious 
their monster chicken fry steak and egg be my all time favorite

oh this be such a thing of beauty this restaurant 
if you havent go here go now

those burgers be amaze 
similarly the delivery man do not say a word of apology when our food be minutes late 
and it be way to expensive 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli be both to die for 
this be my first time and i cant wait until the next 
the bartender be also nice 
everything be good and tasty 
this place be two thumb upway up 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sit or sun 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interest yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 
terrible management 
an excellent new restaurant by an experience frenchman 
if there be zero star i would give it zero star 
great steak great side great wine amaze desserts

i think this restaurant suffer from not try hard enough 
all of the tapas dish be delicious 
i heart this place 
my salad have a bland vinegrette on the baby green and hearts of palm 
after two i felt disgust 
a good time 
i believe that this place be a great stop for those with a huge belly and hanker for sushi 
generous portion and great taste 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommend this place to anyone 
the servers go back and forth several time not even so much as an be you be help 
food be delicious

im not sure how long we stand there but it be long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 
when i open the sandwich i be impress but not in a good way 
will not be back 
there be a warm feel with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 
an extensive menu provide lot of options for breakfast 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which have a wide array of options to choose from 
i have watch their price inflate portion get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 
i get to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 
the wontons be thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 
level spicy be perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 
we be sit right on time and our server from the get go be fantastic 
main thing i didnt enjoy be that the crowd be of older crowd around mid s and up 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again

what do bother me be the slow service

their freeze margaritas be way too sugary for my taste

so in a nutshell the restaraunt smell like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 
my girlfriends veal be very bad 
unfortunately it be not good 
i have a pretty satifying experience

the nachos be a must have 
we will not be come back 
i dont have very many word to say about this place but it do everything pretty well

the chip and salsa be really good the salsa be very fresh 
this place be great 
mediocre food 
once you get inside youll be impress with the place 
im super pissd 
and service be super friendly 
why be these sad little vegetables so overcook 
this place be such a nice surprise 
they be goldencrispy and delicious 
i have high hop for this place since the burgers be cook over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it be devine 
not a single employee come out to see if we be ok or even need a water refill once they finally serve us our food 
lastly the mozzarella stick they be the best thing we order 
the first time i ever come here i have an amaze experience i still tell people how awesome the duck be 
the server be very negligent of our need and make us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 
the service be terrible though 
this place be overprice not consistent with their boba and it really be overprice 
it be pack 
i love this place 
i can say that the desserts be yummy 
the food be terrible 
the seasonal fruit be fresh white peach puree 
it keep get worse and worse so now im officially do 
this place should honestly be blow up 
but i definitely would not eat here again 
do not waste your money here 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as oppose to cram it in little paper takeout box 
the cr√™pe be delicate and thin and moist 
awful service 
wont ever go here again 
food quality have be horrible 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather go 
the service here be fair at best 
i do love sushi but i find kabuki to be overprice overhip and underservices 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 
very poor service 
no one at the table think the food be above average or worth the wait that we have for it 
best service and food ever maria our server be so good and friendly she make our day 
they be excellent 
i pay the bill but do not tip because i felt the server do a terrible job 
just have lunch here and have a great experience 
i have never have such bland food which surprise me consider the article we read focus so much on their spice and flavor 
food be way overprice and portion be fuck small 
i recently try caballeros and i have be back every week since 
for buck a head i really expect better food 
the food come out at a good pace 
i eat there twice on my last visit and especially enjoy the salmon salad 
i wont be back 
we could not believe how dirty the oyster be 
this place deserve no star 
i would not recommend this place 
in fact im go to round up to star just because she be so awesome 
to my disbelief each dish qualify as the worst version of these foods i have ever taste 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it be your job to be nice and polite wash dish otherwise 
the potatoes be great and so be the biscuit 
i probably would not go here again 
so flavorful and have just the perfect amount of heat 
the price be reasonable and the service be great 
the wife hat her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really do not enjoy their meals either 
my fella get the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appeal 
go in for happy hour great list of win 
some may say this buffet be pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you be get quite a lot 
i probably wont be come back here 
worst foodservice ive have in a while 
this place be pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 
hot dish be not hot cold dish be close to room tempi watch staff prepare food with bare hand no gloveseverything be deep fry in oil 
i love their fry and their bean 
always a pleasure deal with him 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwich and everything ive try get my seal of approval 
this place be awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 
for sushi on the strip this be the place to go 
the service be great even the manager come and help with our table 
the feel of the din room be more college cook course than high class din and the service be slow at best 
i start this review with two star but im edit it to give it only one 
this be the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlight by great service a unique menu and a beautiful set 
my boyfriend and i sit at the bar and have a completely delightful experience 
weird vibe from owners 
there be hardly any meat 
ive have better bagels from the grocery store 
go to place for gyros 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which use to be amaze be doughy and flavorless 
i find a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 
the service be terrible food be mediocre 
we definately enjoy ourselves 
i order albondigas soup which be just warm and taste like tomato soup with freeze meatballs 
on three different occasion i ask for well do or medium well and all three time i get the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 
i have about two bite and refuse to eat anymore 
the service be extremely slow 
after minutes wait i get a table 
seriously killer hot chai latte 
no allergy warn on the menu and the waitress have absolutely no clue as to which meals do or do not contain peanuts 
my boyfriend try the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 
their rotate beers on tap be also a highlight of this place 
price be a bite of a concern at mellow mushroom 
worst thai ever 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 
i want to first say our server be great and we have perfect service 
the pizza selections be good 
i have strawberry tea which be good 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 
overall a great experience 
spend your money elsewhere 
their regular toast bread be equally satisfy with the occasional pat of butter mmmm 
the buffet at bellagio be far from what i anticipate 
and the drink be weak people 
my order be not correct 
also i feel like the chip be buy not make in house 
after the disappoint dinner we go elsewhere for dessert 
the chip and sals a here be amaze 
we wont be return 
this be my new fav vegas buffet spot 
i seriously can not believe that the owner have so many unexperienced employees that all be run around like chickens with their head cut off 
very very sad 
i felt insult and disrespect how could you talk and judge another human be like that 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 
im not impress with the concept or the food 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about be their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 
there be really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience be better 
i get food poison here at the buffet 
they bring a fresh batch of fry and i be think yay something warm but no 
what should have be a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember be the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 
needle to say i wont be go back anytime soon 
this place be disgust 
every time i eat here i see care teamwork to a professional degree 
the ri style calamari be a joke 
however there be so much garlic in the fondue it be barely edible 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it be a business lunch 
it be so bad i have lose the heart to finish it 
it also take her forever to bring us the check when we ask for it 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lose the love after this one 
disappoint experience 
the food be about on par with dennys which be to say not good at all 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this be the place for you 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rat be all i be say 
we wont be go back 
the place be fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 
this place lack style 
the sangria be about half of a glass wine full and be ridiculous 
dont bother come here 
the meat be pretty dry i have the slice brisket and pull pork 
the build itself seem pretty neat the bathroom be pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 
it be equally awful 
probably not in a hurry to go back 
very slow at seat even with reservation 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 
the cashew cream sauce be bland and the vegetables be undercooked 
the chipolte ranch dip sause be tasteless seem thin and water down with no heat 
it be a bite too sweet not really spicy enough and lack flavor 
i be very disappoint 
this place be horrible and way overprice 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive be twice and i think it be average at best 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 
the table outside be also dirty a lot of the time and the workers be not always friendly and helpful with the menu 
the ambiance here do not feel like a buffet set but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 
con spotty service 
the fry be not hot and neither be my burger 
but then they come back cold 
then our food come out disappointment ensue 
the real disappointment be our waiter 
my husband say she be very rude do not even apologize for the bad food or anything 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drink just to get some carbs in your stomach 
insult profound deuchebaggery and have to go outside for a smoke break while serve just to solidify it 
if someone order two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it be combo or ala cart 
she be quite disappoint although some blame need to be place at her door 
after all the rave review i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 
del taco be pretty nasty and should be avoid if possible 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 
but i dont like it 
hell no will i go back 
weve have get a much better service from the pizza place next door than the service we receive from this restaurant 
i dont know what the big deal be about this place but i wont be back yaall 
i immediately say i want to talk to the manager but i do not want to talk to the guy who be do shots of fireball behind the bar 
the ambiance isnt much better 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 
the food wasnt good 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer suck 
what happen next be prettyoff put 
too bad cause i know its family own i really want to like this place 
overprice for what you be get 
i vomit in the bathroom mid lunch 
i keep look at the time and it have soon become minutes yet still no food 
i have be to very few place to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this top the list 
we start with the tuna sashimi which be brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 
food be below average 
it sure do beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bite more come from a restaurant 
all in all ha long bay be a bite of a flop 
the problem i have be that they charge for a sandwich that be no bigger than a subway sub which offer better and more amount of vegetables 
shrimp when i unwrap it i live only a mile from brushfire it be literally ice cold 
it lack flavor seem undercooked and dry 
it really be impressive that the place hasnt close down 
i would avoid this place if you be stay in the mirage 
the refried bean that come with my meal be dry out and crusty and the food be bland 
spend your money and time some place else 
a lady at the table next to us find a live green caterpillar in her salad 
the presentation of the food be awful 
i cant tell you how disappoint i be 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both be lack 
appetite instantly go 
overall i be not impress and would not go back 
the whole experience be underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 
then as if i hadnt waste enough of my life there they pour salt in the wind by draw out the time it take to bring the check
